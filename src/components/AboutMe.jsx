                Full-Stack Software Developer based in Coosbay, OR

              </h4>
              <p>
                As a Junior Full-Stack Developer, I utilize 
                cutting-edge developmental libraries/frameworks to 
                create engaging user experiences by writing clean, 
                optimized, and scalable code. My Front-End skills 
                include an expertise in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, 
                React, and SCSS used in designing and maintaining 
                responsive websites that offer a smooth front-end 
                user experience. This contributes to my powerful 
                Back-End system knowledge where I implement SQL/T-SQL 
                stored procedures that provide reliable database 
                systems by creating RESTful .NETCore WEB APIs using 
                C# in Microsoft Visual Studio. This seamlessly links 
                my Front-End designs to my Back-End database systems.
                I look forward to the possiblity of growing with your 
                team!
